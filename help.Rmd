This application is built to demonstrate shiny app functionality. It is basically linear regression project. source data is standard mtcars data set. We build a linear regression model with 3 variables:

* Q Sec
* Car weight
* Transmission type

You can change input variables on left pane, and you can see results on right pane:

*Expected value for miles per gallon
*Plot that demonstrates predicted value vs training data.
